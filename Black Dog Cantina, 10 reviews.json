He is Czech.\n\nIn any case, the menu has an eclectic mix of different types of international finger foods and delicious daily soup specials.\n\nIt's not particularly fancy, but the interior design is casual, the wait staff is friendly enough and the wine list includes glass pricing, so who am I to complain?",

It's good place for a chill with friends but not to come for a romantic dinner",

They even had baby wipes (eco version) :) we visited with our 6month old so definitely appreciate that..\n\nAnyway, I am not sure why this is called LatinAmerican. Aaah maybe because they have nachos and quessadilla. Most of the food is burger, sandwiches and bbq. \n\nThe prices are reasonable i guess for the burger considering the place. The burger and fries were good but not special. They do not offer fries included with burger (or anything else) and they do not bring any salsa or sauce.\n\nThe service - well 3stars.",

Next the Caesar salad, dressing was excellent. For the main course, the 60 day wet aged ribeye. It was cooked to perfection with roasted garlic. We loved everything so much, we came back a second time.",

It was really crowded when we arrived, but we were able to find a table. My husband said his burger was good but nothing special. I would say the same about my salad and and Mac and cheese. We chose this place based on its vicinity to our hotel, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",
