Task II. - Reporting problems

Subtask 1. Get dataset with 10 reviews from your favourite coffee shop or restaurant running any actor on Apify.
	-Google Maps Reviews Scraper works absolutely superb
	-Also as I played in the store, I tried Yelp scraper and tried to scrape reviews for my nearest restaurant (Pivovar Lu≈æiny). On Yelp webside are 5 reviews 
	of which 2 reviews are in Czech, but scraped was only english ones. And I don't know why. :-)

Subtask 2. Get 10 comments from this Tiktok ****post: https://www.tiktok.com/@miri.holkazmoravy/video/7088737832990149894?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1
	-This was hard, because "log in using cookies" was absolutely new to me and I asume it's difficult for common user too. 
	-I was dissapointed when I didn't find anything on it in Info text or in Tutorial for Tik Tok scraper. I would consider adding quick link to Apify Docs, just for good customer experience

Subtask 3. Get 10 results from YouTube containing a search word Minecraft that were posted in the last month and are less then 4-minutes long
	-I used direct URL copied from YT while respective filters were selected
	-Dataset contained only 9 results
	-Cause: YT filter "under 4 minutes long" includes Live streams, where timeline goes backward and present time is always 0:00
	-Fix: I am not sure, if this possible to do...But...If code behind YT scraper could by adjusted to only scrape pre-recorded content. Youtube HTML distinguishes between live stream
	and pre-recorded video using: '.ytp-live-badge' and its attribute must be 'disabled'.
